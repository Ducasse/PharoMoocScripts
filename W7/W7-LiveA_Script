Tips and tricks with Spotter.
Pressing Shift in Spotter will show you all the places you can click on. For
example, let's say we would like to understand the method "do:" better and look
at its implementors.

[[[Spotter
do:
]]]
>> Implementors

Clicking on the arrow will bring you to the different implementors of the method
"do:". Now you can press the arrow again to activate the side panel by clicking
on the grey arrow head on the right. It can display the code or the content of
specific files.
